# Detecting Fish Features Using YOLOv8-based CNN

## Software/Platform 
In our project, we used Python3 in JupyterLab in UVA Rivanna to run our code on both a Mac and Linux computer. The following packages must be installed and loaded:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- yaml
- os
- YOLO from ultralytics
- train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection

## Reproducing Results 
1. Install Python3 and the above packages in Jupyter Notebook on your computer.
2. Read the DataAppendix_Project3.pdf from the DATA folder to familiarize yourself with the variables.
3. Download the DataAppendix.ipynb file from the SCRIPTS folder. This file the analysis using the cleaned dataset, cleaned_foid.csv. 
4. Set up a JupyterLab session in UVA Rivanna and open the DataAppendix.ipynb file in Jupyter.
5. Follow the code to clone this repository and update file paths within the analysis script as necessary, then continue to run each cell in the script.
6. Compare final model results with files in OUTPUT/Results in this repository.
